# Anonymity Browser with Selenium

## Description

This project creates an anonymous web browsing environment using **Selenium** and **Chromium**. The browser ensures privacy by employing various techniques, including spoofing the IP address, user agent, device details, and utilizing a proxy to anonymize browsing sessions. This setup is designed to maintain a high level of anonymity while browsing the web.

## Features

- **Anonymized Browsing**: Spoofs IP, User-Agent, Device, and other headers.
- **Proxy Usage**: Utilizes a proxy to mask the real IP address.
- **Headless Mode**: Optionally runs the browser in headless mode to hide the UI and ensure faster processing.
- **Logging and Warnings**: Detailed logs and real-time warnings in case of potential leaks or anomalies.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Linux and Windows environments.

## Installation

1. **Install Required Libraries**:

   Before running the script, you need to install some required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium webdriver-manager
   ```

2. **Install Chromium**:

   Ensure that **Chromium** is installed on your system. On Linux, you can install it with the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install chromium-browser
   ```

   On Windows, you can download and install **Chromium** or use **Google Chrome** if preferred.

3. **Download ChromeDriver**:

   Selenium requires **ChromeDriver** to interact with Chromium. The script uses `webdriver-manager` to handle this automatically. If needed, you can install it manually from the [ChromeDriver Downloads Page](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

4. **Configure Proxy (Optional)**:

   If you want to use a specific proxy for anonymity, make sure you configure the proxy settings inside the script.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To start the anonymous browser, simply run the Python script:

```bash
python3 browser.py
```

### Script Breakdown

1. **Proxy Configuration**:
   You can specify proxies within the script for browsing anonymously. Modify the proxy settings in the script where the `chrome_options` are defined.

2. **Running in Headless Mode**:
   To run the browser without showing a UI, enable headless mode by adding the following option to `chrome_options`:

   ```python
   chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
   ```

3. **Logs**:
   Logs are saved to the terminal and include details about the anonymization process. If any leak or potential issue is detected, a warning message is shown via the console.

4. **Warnings**:
   If there are any anomalies detected (e.g., IP leakage, unexpected behavior), a warning message will be displayed. Make sure to monitor these warnings to maintain the highest level of anonymity.

## Script Configuration

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

# Configuration for Chromium
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.binary_location = "/usr/bin/chromium"  # Path to Chromium
chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run without UI (optional)
chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")  # Disable sandbox for better compatibility
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")  # Disable shared memory usage

# Example proxy configuration
chrome_options.add_argument("--proxy-server=http://your.proxy.address:port")

# Start browser with anonymized settings
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=chrome_options)
driver.get("https://www.duckduckgo.com")  # Navigate to DuckDuckGo or any other site
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. **Chromium Not Launching**:
   - Ensure Chromium is installed and accessible via your system's PATH (`which chromium`).
   - Ensure **ChromeDriver** is correctly installed and compatible with your version of Chromium.

### 2. **Proxy Issues**:
   - If using a proxy, ensure that the proxy is active and properly configured. Test the proxy connection outside the script to verify that it is functional.

### 3. **Permissions Issues**:
   - If you get permission errors, especially on Linux, ensure that **Chromium** is executable (`chmod +x /usr/bin/chromium`).

### 4. **Headless Mode Problems**:
   - If you're running into issues with headless mode, try disabling it to see if the problem lies within the headless configuration.

## Security Notice

This script is intended for privacy-conscious browsing, but it’s important to note that no solution can guarantee 100% anonymity. Always use additional tools like **VPNs**, **Tor**, or **Whonix** if you require high levels of anonymity.

### Warning

If any leakage or issue is detected during browsing (e.g., unmasked IP address), the script will warn you via the logs. It is advised to check the logs periodically to ensure the browsing session remains fully anonymous.
